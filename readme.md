Phishing Email Analyzer:
A modern, professional web application designed to analyze email content for potential phishing threats. This tool provides a detailed risk assessment using a sophisticated rules-based engine, presented in an engaging and intuitive user interface.

Key Features:
Sleek, Modern UI: A "glassmorphism" design with a subtle animated gradient background provides a premium, industry-standard user experience.

Interactive Risk Dial: Instead of a simple progress bar, results are displayed on a graphical, animated dial for an immediate and clear visual assessment of the threat level.

Comprehensive Analysis: The engine scans the sender's address, subject line, and email body for a wide range of red flags, including:

Commonly impersonated or misspelled domains.

Urgent or enticing language.

Requests for credentials and financial information.

Masked URLs and suspicious links.

Poor grammar and unprofessional tone.

Actionable Recommendations: The analysis report doesn't just provide a score; it gives clear, actionable advice on what to do next (e.g., "Delete Immediately," "Verify Sender Independently").

Dark & Light Mode: A user-controlled theme toggle ensures comfortable viewing in any lighting condition.

Sample Emails: Includes one-click buttons to load sample phishing and legitimate emails for easy testing and demonstration.
