Phishing Email Detector
This project is a simple, client-side web application that helps users detect potential phishing emails. Users can paste the content of a suspicious email into the application, and it will analyze the text based on a set of heuristics to determine a risk score.

Features
Text Analysis: Scans email content for common phishing keywords and phrases.

Risk Scoring: Calculates and displays a risk score to indicate the likelihood of the email being a phishing attempt.

Detailed Flags: Lists the specific red flags found in the email content.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

No Server Needed: The entire analysis runs in the browser, ensuring user privacy as the email content is never sent to a server.
